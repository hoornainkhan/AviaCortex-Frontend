AviaTrust: Predictive Aircraft Maintenance Platform
AviaTrust is a unified, data-driven platform that transforms aircraft maintenance from a reactive to a predictive and fully verifiable model. It is designed to ensure the highest levels of safety and accountability in the aviation industry.

Core Features
1. Predictive Health Scoring Engine
This feature ingests and analyzes data from all available sourcesâ€”including technical logs, component cycles, pilot reports, and remote sensor checks. It generates a real-time, dynamic health score for each aircraft and its critical systems, allowing airlines to identify and address developing issues before they become critical.

2. Fleet-Wide Priority Dashboard
A central dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the entire fleet's health. It features a prioritized maintenance queue where aircraft with the lowest health scores or most critical warnings are automatically moved to the top. This ensures that resources are allocated where they are needed most, optimizing efficiency and safety.

3. Authenticated Visual Workflow
A mobile application for engineers enforces a strict, evidence-based maintenance process.

Visual Proof: Mandates the upload of timestamped "before" and "after" photos for every repair.

Dual Digital Sign-Off: Requires secure, cryptographic sign-offs from both a Senior Engineer and a Quality Engineer to authenticate and close a maintenance task.

4. Immutable Maintenance Ledger
Every maintenance action, log entry, photograph, and digital signature is recorded as a transaction on a private blockchain. This creates a permanent, unalterable, and instantly auditable history for an aircraft's entire lifecycle, serving as a single source of truth for airlines, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies.
